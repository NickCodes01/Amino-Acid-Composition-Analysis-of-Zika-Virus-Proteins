# Amino-Acid-Composition-Analysis-of-Zika-Virus-Proteins
This bioinformatics pipeline processes DNA sequences from a FASTA file by transcribing them to mRNA, translating them into amino acid sequences, and quantifying amino acid frequencies. The resulting amino acid distribution is visualized, offering insights into the proteomic composition of Zika virus sequences.
